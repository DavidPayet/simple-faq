This project is a responsive FAQ page built as part of the [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io) challenge. The goal was to create a clean and accessible FAQ page that adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Semantic HTML**: Structuring content with proper HTML5 elements for better accessibility.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Aligning and distributing elements efficiently in a container.
